        </p>
        Depression, also known as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), is the leading cause of disability in the world,
        and it is a very common disorder that. It causes a persistent sense of emotional sadness and makes it difficult
        to do other jobs. The onset of depression is not limited by age, race, or physical health. Depression can also
        lead to other mental illnesses and can have serious consequences. The reason why I want to explore this topic is
        because it takes a long time to find effective treatments for depression. Even though there are many treatments
        available that have been proven to be effective. However, not all methods are effective for different people.
        Sometimes multiple treatments have to be tried to find one that works, but this can be a very time-consuming and
        frustrating process. The risk of recurrence of depression during this process is high as well as the financial
        constraints. So far, we still can't say that there is one approach that is the most effective but is there one
        approach that will allow most people to alleviate their depressive symptoms. And it can reduce the burden
        without excessive risk of relapse and financial difficulties.
        </p>

        </p>
        More than 9 million commercially insured Americans have been diagnosed with depression - a number that has
        climbed 33 percent since 2013. In fact, 89 percent of American adults say depression is a very serious or
        somewhat serious condition. Yet, 2 million of those diagnosed with depression in 2016 did not seek treatment. As
        more and more medication and behavioral treatment options become available, it is critical to connect people
        with personalized treatment that works for them.

        So therefore I used some data that can find out which treatment are the most effective for the Major
        Depression Disorder. And by applying different method on it I will try to give some suggestion about treatment
        for the patients.
