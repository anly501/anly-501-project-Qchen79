        <font size="5"><b>Conclusion</b></font>
    </h1>

    <p style="color:rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.895);">
        What question I have answered:
    <p>

    <p style="color:rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.895);">
        1. If there is significant difference in gender and age factors on drug use?
    <p>

    <p style="color:rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.895);">
        2. AMITRIPTYLINE is the most effective drug among those four groups?
    <p>

    <p style="color:rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.895);">
        3. Among AMITRIPTYLINE, BUPROPION, and CITALOPRAM those three method which one is the best?
    <p>

    <p style="color:rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.895);">
        4. Which two drug use appear together the most on treatment of Depression.
    <p>

    <p style="color:rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.895);">
        Considering the different age and gender, different drugs will definitely have different effects on different
        groups. So I designed the first question. The whole group of dataset is divided into four groups, namely young
        men, young women, old men and old women, which can help doctors to find out the suitable method for each group.
        drug use is only one method of treating depression. If drug use is not very effective for a certain group, then
        drug use can be excluded at the beginning of treatment consideration. This will also save time.
    <p>

    <p style="color:rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.895);">
        In the case of helping doctors to determine the drug use that will be implemented. We will want to know the
        effectiveness of each drug for different groups, so we designed a second question. We conclude that
        AMITRIPTYLINE is the most effective method for young men. However, different drugs may be most effective for
        different groups. In this case, we can target different groups with different drugs. The ultimate goal is also
        to save time.
    <p>

    <p style="color:rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.895);">
        The third question is without considering gender and age. Which drug would be more effective for all groups. The
        goal of this question is to help the doctor find out which drug is more effective in the total population.
        Identify the most effective one. This will help the doctor to understand the best and most common methods among
        the many drug uses.
    <p>

    <p style="color:rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.895);">
        The fourth question is to consider the case where two drugs are used together. Realistically, it is possible
        that the effectiveness of using only one drug is not very high. So when considering the use of two drugs
        together which two combinations together would be the best?
    <p>

    <h2 style="color:rgba(26, 81, 183, 0.895);; text-align:justify; ">
        <font size="2"><b>Answer to Question1:If there is significant difference in gender and age factors on drug
                use?</b></font>
    </h2>

    <p style="color:rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.895);">
        First is for the conclusion of Naive Bayes method on the record data. This section basically explains about if
        there is significant difference in gender and age factors on drug use. We can see that training data set and
        test data set all have about the same accuracy which is about 53%. And for both training data set and test data
        set it all have the highest accuracy of about 88% for the second group, namely, the older male group. It was
        followed by young men, meaning men who is younger than 40, with an accuracy rate of about 25 percent. And the
        last two group young women and old women have pretty bad accuracy. Which indicating that these drugs have no
        significant change in women, so it can be said that the effect on women is not great.

        <font size="2"><b>Answer to Question2:AMITRIPTYLINE is the most effective drug among those four groups?</b>
        </font>
    </h2>

    <p style="color:rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.895);">
        Second is for the conclusion of SVM method and based on the accuracy above I use linear kernel to make
        conclusion about AMITRIPTYLINE is the most effective drug among those four groups. And the result is that it has
        the most significant effect on young male group. Since I only show one drug effectiveness in my website. And if
        you want to know more about each drug use you can download my code and simply change the drug name according to
        my data. And then you will get the result.

        <font size="2"><b>Answer to Question3:Among AMITRIPTYLINE, BUPROPION, and CITALOPRAM those three method which
                one is the best?</b>
        </font>
    </h2>

    <p style="color:rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.895);">
        Third is for the conclusion of the Decision Tree method. This section answered about which drug among those
        three drugs(AMITRIPTYLINE, BUPROPION, and CITALOPRAM) are most fit the Decision Tree method which means are more
        effective among all group. The decision tree model is best fit for drug AMITRIPTYLINE compared to the other 2
        drugs. Since AMITRIPTYLINE have the highest accuracy score which is 82.4%. So, AMITRIPTYLINE is the most
        affective drug among those 3 drugs.

    <p style="color:rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.895);">
        Also, in the group old women and young men have the highest and same f1 score which is 0.84. And since we have
        the conclusion from SVM method that in the use of AMITRIPTYLINE has the most significant effect on young male
        group. So we can conclude that in the case of AMITRIPTYLINE drug use, it can perform good for young men in
        compare BUPROPION and CITALOPRAM.

    <p>

    <p style="color:rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.895);">
        Fourth is for the conclusion of Clustering. It did not have conclusion about drug use and only help us to
        cluster the dataset. And overall, the Kmeans method cluster the data point best. Since I have four groups and it
        also indicate there will be 4 clusters. So based on this dataset, Kmeans method perform the best.

        <font size="2"><b>Answer to Question4:Which two drug use appear together the most on treatment of

        </font>
    </h2>
    <p style="color:rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.895);">
        For the conclusion of ARM method, we can conclude that CITALOPRAM and ESCITALOPRAM appear together the most on
        treatment of Depression.

    </h1>
    <p style="color:rgba(7, 7, 7, 0.895);">
        Now I have given answer for several questions. I think it can help doctors to make some recommendations on drug
        use, although the drugs needed are different for different people. But after the data analysis, we can make some
        narrow down of the drug use, which can treat the depression more efficiently and help the patient to get rid of
        the depression in a shorter time. Of course, the analysis I did leaves a lot to be desired. And there are more
        questions that can be analyzed.
        If you want more in-depth analysis and discussion of this project, you can contact me through the homepage.
