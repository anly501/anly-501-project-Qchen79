        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Qian Chen. My undergraduate school was the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. That's a very
            cold place. And my undergraduate major is statistics. I hope I can learn more about how to use python for
            analysis, and machine learning, deep learning. My ideal job would probably be DS or SDE. I'm still
            exploring, so
            not really sure. I really like playing badmintons and finding good restaurants.
        <p>

        </p>
        Depression, also known as major depressive disorder (MDD), is the leading cause of disability in the world, and
        it
        is a very common disorder that. It causes a persistent sense of emotional sadness and makes it difficult to do
        other jobs. The onset of depression is not limited by age, race, or physical health. Depression can also lead to
        other mental illnesses and can have serious consequences.
        The reason why I want to explore this topic is because it takes a long time to find effective treatments for
        depression. Even though there are many treatments available that have been proven to be effective. However, not
        all methods are effective for different people. Sometimes multiple treatments have to be tried to find one that
        works, but this can be a very time-consuming and frustrating process. The risk of recurrence of depression
        during
        this process is high as well as the financial constraints.
        So far, we still can't say that there is one approach that is the most effective but is there one approach that
        will allow most people to alleviate their depressive symptoms. And it can reduce the burden without excessive
        risk
        of relapse and financial difficulties.</p>

        </p>
        Question that I want to answer:
        </p>
        </p>
        1. Do we have effective way to treat depression.
        </p>
        </p>
        2. How many people can get rid of depression? And what treatment do they have
        </p>
        </p>
        3. How do we measure if a treatment is effective?
        </p>
        </p>
        4. Is there a most common way to treat depression?
        </p>
        </p>
        5. Is there treatment difference between different country? Like US and China
        </p>
        </p>
        6. Usually how many treatments patient need to try to find the best one?
        </p>
        </p>
        7. whether it is possible that no treatment will work for a person.
        </p>
        </p>
        8. How do we diagnose someone as MDD?
        </p>
        </p>
        9. Can surgery be used to completely treat depression?
        </p>
        </p>
        10. Is there a high probability of relapse? Is there a high likelihood of worsening depression?
        </p>
        </p>
        11. How depression treatment affects your daily life?
        </p>
        </p>
        12. Do patients with depression have the same characteristics
        </p>
